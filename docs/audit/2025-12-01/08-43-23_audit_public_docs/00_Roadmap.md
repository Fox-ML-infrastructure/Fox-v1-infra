# Audit Public-Facing Documents — Roadmap (2025-12-01)

**Prompt:** "Check all public facing documents for AI/prompt references"

## Context
- User wants to ensure no references to AI generation or prompts in public docs
- Already removed one section from CONSULTING_PRICING.md
- Need to verify all public-facing consulting documents

## Plan (now)
1) Check README.md, CONSULTING.md, CONSULTING_POLICY.md, CONSULTING_PRICING.md, MASTER_CONSULTING_AGREEMENT.md, STATEMENT_OF_WORK.md
2) Search for AI-assistant phrases, prompt references, generation offers
3) Remove any found references

## Success criteria
- All public-facing documents are clean of AI/prompt references
- Documents read as professionally written, not AI-generated
