Reflection on the Aurora Project
29 November 2025

This document reflects my personal thoughts about the Aurora project and the process of developing it over the past year. Although this is not an academic assignment, I want to present the context behind the work in a clear and transparent way. If the tone reads personal at times, it is because the project itself was an intensely personal learning experience.

The initial motivation for the project arose unexpectedly. A conversation with someone I met while playing Path of Exile 2 first introduced me to the idea of creating a system of this kind. At the time, I did not realize that quantitative finance and algorithmic trading were among the most challenging areas of applied machine learning. Despite this, the difficulty kept my interest, and I continued developing the project out of curiosity and a desire to understand complex systems.

The development process consisted largely of self-guided learning: asking questions, experimenting, researching, and iterating over approximately 2,500 to 3,000 hours. I learned primarily through online resources, such as instructional channels including Socratica, tonybtw, and Tsoding, alongside various others. I also used AI-assisted tools as a supplemental tutor when learning difficult concepts or debugging ideas late at night. This method suited me better than traditional lectures or book-based study, especially for understanding topics such as leakage, feature correlations, and other subtleties in machine learning workflows.

This project is not intended as financial advice, nor is it a guarantee of performance. It contains imperfections, silent errors, and areas that require caution from anyone who explores or extends it. It was not designed as a commercial product, and therefore lacks user interfaces, payment logic, account systems, or other features typically found in polished software. If anyone chooses to experiment with it privately, I welcome feedback on structural issues, silent errors, or improvements others may discover.

I recognize that some of the equations and mathematical components included in the project originate from established sources, and I did my best to credit those who developed them. Mathematics can be challenging for me in symbolic form, and I often find it easier to interpret concepts when expressed as functions or computational procedures. Any similarities between my implementations and those used elsewhere are unintentional, and where convergence occurred, it was due to independent reasoning rather than copying proprietary work.

At one stage, I considered the idea of monetizing the project due to external influences and suggestions. However, the primary value of Aurora, for me, lies in what I learned while creating it and in offering something that others can study if they wish. The project ultimately represents a learning journey rather than a business pursuit.

It has been meaningful to enjoy learning again. Although this text is not formatted as a formal research paper, I want it to communicate honestly what the project meant to me and how it came into being. My aim is not to present myself as an expert or as an authority, but simply as a computer science student who learns best through experimentation, conversation, and hands-on exploration.

I hope this reflection answers any questions about the motivations behind Aurora. Transparency matters to me, and I want people reading or using the project to understand its origins and limitations. Despite any imperfections in this writing, this represents my genuine perspective at the time of authorship.
