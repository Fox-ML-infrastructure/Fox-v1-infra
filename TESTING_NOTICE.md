# Testing Notice

**Status**: Testing Underway

- Performance characteristics may vary depending on hardware and dataset size
- Edge cases and error handling are still being validated

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter issues during testing:
1. Check existing issues in the repository
2. Verify your configuration matches the expected format
3. Review recent changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Report issues with sufficient detail (config, error messages, environment)

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring test results
- Address any issues that arise
- Update this notice as testing progresses
