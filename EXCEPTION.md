Violating this clause immediately voids permission.

---

This additional permission is **not transferable**.  
Institutions may not sublicense, extend, or pass this permission to others.

---

## 7. Termination
Any violation of these conditions results in **automatic and immediate termination** of this additional permission.  
Standard AGPL rights remain unaffected; only the expanded institutional permissions terminate.

---

## Automatic Termination

This Additional Permission terminates immediately and without notice if:

- the institution weakens, removes, or fails to enforce protections for **ANY** marginalized group,
- the institution protects some minorities while discriminating against others (cherry-picking is prohibited),
- the institution engages in any prohibited financial activity,

Upon termination, the institution must immediately cease all institutional, operational, and analytical 
use of the software.


## No Interpretive Loopholes Clause

This Additional Permission is to be interpreted strictly and solely according to its written intent:
to ensure comprehensive protection of **ALL** marginalized groups and public-interest benefit. Any attempt to reinterpret, narrow, 
redefine, or exploit wording for the purpose of bypassing these protections is invalid.

If a use-case does not clearly and unambiguously support protection of **ALL** marginalized groups or public-good missions, 
the use is prohibited.

---

## Warning Against Bad-Faith or Strategic Misuse

Any attempt to exploit, reinterpret, or narrow the meaning of this Additional Permission 
for purposes of bypassing protections for marginalized groups or enabling financial profit-seeking is 
considered a violation. 

**Institutions cannot cherry-pick protections. Protecting one group while discriminating against others is prohibited.**

If a use-case is not clearly and unambiguously aligned with comprehensive protection of **ALL** marginalized groups or public-good 
missions, it is prohibited.

---

## Creator Protection Clause

Use of this software is prohibited in contexts where the creator has been the target of 
harassment, discrimination, professional sabotage, or abuse by the institution or its representatives.

This prohibition applies to:
- institutions with documented harassment or discrimination against the creator
- institutions that have engaged in professional sabotage or abuse toward the creator
- institutions whose representatives have participated in targeted harassment of the creator
- any use that would contradict the protective purpose of this project

This clause is enforceable based on documented behavior and evidence, not personal vendetta.

---

## Hostile Actor Exclusion

The following entities are explicitly excluded from institutional use of this software:

- Any entity with a documented record of discrimination against **ANY** marginalized groups
- Any entity with policies that harm **ANY** marginalized people
- Any entity that protects some minorities while discriminating against others (cherry-picking protections)
- Any entity that participates in targeted harassment, including toward the creator or marginalized communities
- Any entity whose use would contradict the purpose of this project
- Any entity that has engaged in professional sabotage, abuse, or harassment of the creator

**Institutions must protect ALL minorities comprehensively. Selective protection is not sufficient.**

This exclusion is based on documented behavior and institutional policies, not personal feelings.
