# Fox ML Infrastructure — Strategic Roadmap

FoxML Core is the core research and training engine of Fox ML Infrastructure.

Direction and priorities for ongoing development. Timelines are aspirational and subject to change.

---

## Development Philosophy

FoxML Core is maintained with an **enterprise reliability mindset**:
* Critical issues are fixed immediately.
* Documentation and legal compliance are treated as first-class deliverables.
* Stability always precedes new features.
* GPU acceleration, orchestration, and model tooling will remain backwards-compatible.
* **UI integration approach** — UI is intentionally decoupled from the core. FoxML Core provides Python programmatic interfaces and integration points so teams can plug into their existing dashboards, monitoring tools, or UX layers. *As always, priorities are subject to change based upon client demand.*

## What Works Today

**You can use these capabilities right now:**

* ✅ **Full TRAINING Pipeline** — Complete one-command workflow: target ranking → feature selection → training plan generation → model training
* ✅ **Training Routing & Planning System** — Config-driven routing decisions, automatic training plan generation, 2-stage training pipeline (CPU → GPU), plan-aware filtering
* ✅ **GPU-Accelerated Model Training** — Train all 20 model families (LightGBM, XGBoost, MLP, LSTM, Transformer, CNN1D, etc.) with GPU acceleration where available
* ✅ **Centralized YAML Configuration** — Complete Single Source of Truth (SST) system with structured configs for experiments, model families, and system parameters

## Core System Status

* **TRAINING Pipeline — Phase 1** ✅ — Fully operational. Intelligent training framework (target ranking, feature selection, automated leakage detection) integrated and working. **End-to-end testing currently underway** to validate full pipeline from target ranking → feature selection → training plan → model training.

* **Training Routing & Planning System** 🔄 (2025-12-11) — **NEW - Currently being tested**: 
  - Config-driven routing decisions (cross-sectional vs symbol-specific vs both vs experimental vs blocked)
  - Automatic routing plan and training plan generation
  - 2-stage training pipeline (CPU models first, then GPU models) for all 20 model families
  - One-command end-to-end flow: `intelligent_trainer` orchestrates complete pipeline
  - Training plan auto-detection and filtering
  - See [Training Routing Guide](DOCS/02_reference/training_routing/README.md)

* **Single Source of Truth (SST) & Determinism** ✅ (2025-12-10) — Complete config centralization for TRAINING; SST enforcement test; all hyperparameters and seeds load from YAML; centralized determinism system. 30+ hardcoded `random_state` and defaults removed.

* **Model Family Status Tracking** ✅ — Comprehensive debugging system to identify which families succeed/fail in multi-model feature selection. Status persisted to JSON for analysis.

* **GPU Families** ✅ — All GPU model families operational and producing artifacts. Expect some noise and warnings during training (harmless, do not affect functionality).

* **Sequential Models** ✅ — All sequential models (CNN1D, LSTM, Transformer, TabCNN, TabLSTM, TabTransformer) working and producing outputs. 3D preprocessing issues resolved.

* **Target Ranking & Selection** ✅ — Integrated and operational as part of Phase 1 pipeline.

* **Documentation Overhaul** ✅ — 55+ new files created, 50+ rewritten, standardized across all tiers. Internal docs organized into `INTERNAL_DOCS/` for planning/architecture, public docs in `DOCS/` for operational use.

* **Legal Compliance** ✅ — Enhanced with IP assignment agreement, regulatory disclaimers, and compliance documentation. Compliance assessment: 95% complete (after IP assignment signing).

# Development Priorities

## Near-Term Focus

**Active development priorities — commercially leverageable work:**

1. **Training Routing System Testing & Validation** 🔄 — Complete end-to-end testing of routing system, validate 2-stage training pipeline, verify plan filtering behavior
2. **Symbol-Specific Training Execution** — Integrate symbol-specific job execution filtering (plan generated, needs pipeline integration)
3. **Model-Family-Level Filtering** — Use per-job model families from training plan in execution phase
4. **Configuration system validation & logging revamp** — Complete validation layer, unified logging, naming cleanup (mostly complete, validation in progress)
5. **Memory batching + Polars optimizations** — Fix unstable batching behavior, enable large-scale training without OOM
6. **Model integration interfaces** — Standard interfaces for integrating trained models with external systems
7. **Website + Stripe checkout** — Public homepage, pricing tiers, purchase flow, hosted docs

**Guideline:** These priorities build on the completed Phase 0–2 foundation and represent the next commercially-leverageable deltas. Focus remains on validation, polish, and strategic sequencing rather than new major subsystems.

## Longer-Term / R&D

**Research and future-track work — not blocking near-term goals:**

8. **GPU + ranking regression testing** — Ongoing validation and edge-case coverage
9. **Production readiness** — Full test coverage, monitoring, deployment guides, disaster recovery
10. **Exploratory modules** — Experimental features and research tracks
11. **NVLink & multi-GPU exploration** — Research phase, performance benchmarking, architecture design
12. **High-performance rewrite track** — Low-level rewrites (C/C++/Rust), HPC alignment (planned/WIP), ROCm support (planned)

**Guideline:** These items represent longer-horizon research and infrastructure work. They are valuable but not prerequisites for near-term commercial readiness.
