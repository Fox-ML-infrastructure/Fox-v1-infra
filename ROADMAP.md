# Roadmap (Winter 2025)

Development during the holiday season will be limited to **documentation cleanup only**.  
No feature work, configuration changes, or major updates are planned until after January.

### Holiday Work (Light Only)

- **Documentation Cleanup**
  - Improve clarity and readability across existing docs.
  - Consolidate or reorganize sections where needed.
  - Fix formatting inconsistencies and polish explanations.
  - Add small clarifications or examples if helpful.

### Post-Holiday (January 2025 and Beyond)

Larger development tasks will resume after the holiday break, including:
- Centralizing configuration into YAML files.
- Improving output formatting for better readability and LLM parsing.
- Exploring potential new module work (e.g., toon implementation).
- Additional system improvements based on feedback.

After an intense development pace since the summer, the holiday period will focus solely on light doc cleanup. Active development resumes in January.
