## Roadmap (Winter 2025)

There are a few light updates planned for Fox ML Infrastructure during the holiday season, mostly documentation and small quality-of-life improvements.

I've been working at a pretty intense pace since the summer, so I'm taking some well-earned rest.  
Active development will resume in January.
