# Roadmap (Winter 2025 → 2026)

Development during **Winter 2025 (right now)** is intentionally limited to
**light documentation cleanup only**.  
No major feature work will begin until **January 2026**.

## Current Work (Winter 2025 — Docs Only)
- Improve clarity and readability across existing documentation.
- Fix formatting inconsistencies and reorganize sections where needed.
- Add small clarifications or examples where helpful.

**No feature development until January 2026.**

## Planned Work (Beginning January 2026)

### 1. Centralized Configuration
- Move scattered configuration variables into structured YAML files.
- Create a standard, documented configuration schema.
- Add basic validation and provide example configs.

### 2. Improved Output & UX Formatting
- Make logs and pipeline outputs more readable and consistent.
- Introduce structured, LLM-friendly formatting for easier automated parsing.
- Clean up naming conventions across modules.

### 3. Public Website + Automated Payments
- Launch the official Fox ML Infrastructure website.
- Integrate automated Stripe payments for eligible commercial tiers.
- Add a polished “Request Access / Contact” flow for enterprise clients.
- Present documentation, pricing, onboarding, and system overview in one place.

### 4. Exploratory Module Work
- Explore potential toon implementation or related extensions.
- Improve or extend system internals based on user evaluations.

### 5. Lower-Level Rewrites (Performance & Integration)
- Begin rewriting performance-critical components in lower-level languages
  (e.g., C/C++/Rust) where it meaningfully improves speed or system efficiency.
- Improve interoperability with existing high-performance libraries.
- Build a foundation for future high-throughput, HPC-aligned capabilities.

## Summary
**Winter 2025 = documentation cleanup only.**  
**January 2026 and onward = configuration system, UX/output improvements,
website + payments, exploratory module work, and performance-oriented lower-level rewrites.**
