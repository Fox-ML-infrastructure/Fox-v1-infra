  # List of symbols to use (5 symbols for comprehensive testing)
  symbols: [AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA]
  
  # Bar interval
  interval: 5m
  
  # Reduced limits for faster testing (increase for production)

  # Evaluate all discovered targets (no limit)
  top_n_targets: 100  # High limit to get all targets
  
  # Maximum targets to evaluate (set high for comprehensive test)
  max_targets_to_evaluate: 100  # Will evaluate all valid targets
  
  # Auto-discover features

targets:
  # Primary target (fallback if manual_targets not specified)

# FEATURE SELECTION CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

    - xgboost
    - random_forest

# ============================================================================
# TRAINING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
training:
  # Model families to train (same as feature selection for consistency)

    - lightgbm
    - xgboost

# ============================================================================
# DECISION CONFIGURATION (Auto-Config Application)
# ============================================================================
decisions:
  # Application mode: "off" (assist mode only), "dry_run" (show patch), "apply" (auto-apply)
  apply_mode: "off"  # Disabled for comprehensive testing (focus on evaluation)
  
  # Minimum decision level to apply
  min_level_to_apply: 2
  
  # Bayesian patch policy (disabled for comprehensive test)
  use_bayesian: false  # Disabled to focus on raw evaluation

# ============================================================================
# PARALLEL EXECUTION CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Multi-target parallel execution (ENABLED for faster comprehensive testing)
multi_target:
  # Enable parallel target evaluation (ProcessPoolExecutor)
  parallel_targets: true
  
  # Continue to next target if one fails (important for comprehensive test)
  skip_on_error: true
  
  # Save multi_target_summary.json
  save_summary: true

# Feature selection parallel execution (ENABLED for faster testing)
multi_model_feature_selection:
  # Enable parallel symbol processing (ProcessPoolExecutor)
  parallel_symbols: true

# Threading/parallel worker configuration
threading:
  parallel:
    # Max workers for ProcessPoolExecutor (CPU-bound tasks)
    # Set to 8 for comprehensive test (utilize all cores)
    max_workers_process: 8  # Increased for comprehensive test
    
    # Max workers for ThreadPoolExecutor (I/O-bound tasks)
    max_workers_thread: 8   # Increased for comprehensive test
    
    # Master switch for parallel execution
    enabled: true

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# - This config tests ALL discovered targets from the data
# - Parallel execution is enabled for faster testing
# - Data limits are reduced for speed (increase for production)
# - This will generate comprehensive rankings across all targets
# - Expect longer runtime but complete coverage of all targets
# - Results will show which targets are most predictable
# - Compare scores: honest baseline (~0.52-0.54) vs repainting targets (~0.70+)
